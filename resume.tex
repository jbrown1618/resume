    \item Re-implemented the application-wide search, reducing end-to-end request time by a factor of 1000
    \item Led a small team in building a proof-of-concept for a ``next-phase'' application built on
          Spring Boot and Angular 4, which was in turn used as a prototype for new projects company-wide,
          and consulted for other teams using it as a template
    \item Implemented a report automation system, replacing over a dozen manual reports per month
  }

  \experience{MetLife Tech University Professional Program}{MetLife Inc.}{2014}{
    \item Re-implemented part of one of MetLife's largest enterprise applications used by over 1300 claims
          administrators to handle over 800,000 disability claims a year, working on a small, Agile team
    \item Reduced end-to-end search time by 42\% by replacing the outdated user interface with a Single Page
          Application built on Angular, Spring MVC, and a RESTful back end
    \item Achieved the only perfect score for Technical Aptitude on my team
  }

  \experience{Supplemental Instruction Leader}{UNC Department of Physics}{2013--2014}{
    \item Planed and led three weekly Supplemental Instruction sessions to teach students effective problem
          solving strategies

    \item Generated enough interest to draw users and contributors from across Data Visualization R\&D
  }

  \project{Predicting Mortgage Rates}{
    \item Used data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to build an ensemble model which combines
          the outputs of a gradient boosting algorithm and a random forest to predict
          whether a mortgage will be approved
    \item Designed a flexible, metadata-driven architecture which can easily accommodate new features
          without a code change.
